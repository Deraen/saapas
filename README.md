Opinionated example project for ClojureScript using Boot instead of Leiningen.
Was inspired by [chestnut] but has grown since to include other stuff to
demonstrate Boot.

This is not an Leiningen template as I don't believe in setting up complex
projects automatically. Instead you should study this project and copy
only stuff you need and understand.

### Prerequisites

You should first [install Boot][install]. Also you should be running the
latest version.

## Features

- Uses [component] and [reloaded.repl] to provide utilities to `start`,
  `stop` and `reset` (reload) the app.
- Simple [Compojure][compojure] backend
- Simple [Om][om] frontend
- [LESS][less] to write stylesheets
  - [boot-less] is able to import files from classpath
  - You can add dependency to e.g. bootstrap from [webjars][webjars] to
    your regular dependencies and then use `@import "bootstrap/less/bootstrap.less"`
    on your `.less` files.
- `dev` task starts the whole development workflow
  - Check `boot dev --help` for options
  - Repl should automatically include cljs middlewares
  - [Browser repl][boot-cljs-repl] included
  - No need to change `index.html`, resulting *unified* JS can be loaded like `:advanced` compiled.
  - Watches for file changes
    - \*.less changes trigger less compilation
    - \*.cljs changes trigger [cljs][boot-cljs] compilation
  - [Live-reloading][boot-reload]
    - \*.js, \*.css, \*.html changes send notification to browser throught websocket and browser loads the new files
- `package` task creates uberjar
  - Cljs will be compiled using `:advanced` optimization
  - Uses minified react.js

## Usage

To start everything run:
```
$ boot dev
boot.user=>
# App should now be running, you can use following commands to restart the app
boot.user=> (stop) ; Stop app
boot.user=> (start) ; Start app
boot.user=> (reset) ; Stop, reload all namespaces, start
```

If you want a repl where you can execute commands, you can start a nrepl
client which connects to the nrepl server started by the dev task by running
```
$ boot repl -c
```

## TODO
